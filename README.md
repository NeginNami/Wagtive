# Wagtive
Wagtive is a web app that gamifies fitness and social activity for dog owners. The goal is to provide a range of activities including mile tracking, suggested actvities (hiking trails, pet-friendly places), challenges, and more. The user can progress through various levels, the lowest being a puppy, the highest an alpha dog. With each accomplishment the user earns badges and varying point amounts. The goal is to get active with Wagtive!
